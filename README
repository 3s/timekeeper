Welcome to Timekeeper

What is timekeeper?
Timekeeper helps you to keep track of your occupations.

How to use it?
Click on "New" in the menu. Here you can add a new task.
You can choose between "Start" or "Save".
Start: starts your task and when you're done, you can end it by clicking stop.
       This is possible on the page "Timekeeper" in the table "Started".
       You're not obligated to fill in all the fields.
Save: this is used when you need to enter a task you've done earlier.
      With this option you'll need to fill in each field.

There is an option to edit and delete your occupations.
This is to be found in the table "Completed".

If you want to see some tasks you've already done, you can use "Search".
Just fill in the fields. Again, you're not obligated to fill in all the fields.
